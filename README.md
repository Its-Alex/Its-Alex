# Readme about me

This is my readme, a documentation about myself. It contains what I know, how I
work and also why. I think this will help people to get to know me and how I like
to work.

## Who am I ?

I'm Alexandre, a [software craftsman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship)
(as I frequently mention, ever since encountering this term). I work as a
[Fullstack Developer](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_fullstack.asp) and
[DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) enthusiast, striving to
comprehend the inner workings of all things.

I started learning [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))
at home when I was sixteen years old. Quickly, I developed
a real love for this field and chose to deepen my knowledge [42 school](https://42.fr/).

I am a fervent supporter of
[open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) and strive to
contribute and help projects on Github or other platforms whenever possible. I
am curious and love to learn and discover new things, which makes me a
Jack-of-all-trades.

I try to put into practice [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public),
you can follow what I do in my [backlog](https://github.com/Its-Alex/backlog/issues) and
see my [playground projects](https://github.com/Its-Alex?tab=repositories&q=playground).

I feel safe and happy in a structured environment. I think I'm better when I
can create a mind map of my work environment in my head.

## Tips about me

Here are some quick tips that will help you to understand me:

- By default, I tend to have high expectations, whether in reviews or during
  discussions. Feel free to bring it up to me, and I'll adjust to better fit the situation.
- I have a strong focus on continuous improvement and am dedicated to resolving
  issues thoroughly. When I identify a problem, I bring it up frequently and
  am committed to seeing it through until it is fully resolved.
- **You can feel safe debating with me**. I find that ideas improve by being
  examined from all angles. This does rely on us being able to have a
  safe debate. If something goes wrong, please let me know so I can try to fix it.
- I type too fast and make spelling mistakes where there isn't a native spell
  checker. I'm working on it. üòÅ
