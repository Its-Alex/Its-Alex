# Readme about me

This is my readme, a documentation about myself. It contains what I know, how I
work and also why. I think this will help people to get to know me and how I like
to work.

# Who am I ?

I'm Alexandre, a [`software craftsman`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship)
(as I frequently mention, ever since encountering this term). I work as a
[`Fullstack Developer`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stack) and
[`DevOps`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) enthusiast, striving to
comprehend the inner workings of all things.

# Tips

Here are some quick tips that will help you to understand me:

- **You feel safe debating with me**. I find that ideas improve by being
  examined from all angles. If it sounds like I'm disagreeing I'm most likely
  just playing devil's advocate. This does rely on us being able to have a
  safe debate.
- I type too fast and make spelling mistakes where there isn't a native spell
  checker. I'm working on it. üòÅ
