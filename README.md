# Readme about me

This is my readme, a documentation about myself. It contains what I know, how I
work and also why. I think this will help people to get to know me and how I like
to work.

## Who am I ?

I'm Alexandre, a [`software craftsman`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship)
(as I frequently mention, ever since encountering this term). I work as a
[`Fullstack Developer`](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_fullstack.asp) and
[`DevOps`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) enthusiast, striving to
comprehend the inner workings of all things.

I started learning [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))
at home when I was sixteen years old. Quickly, I developed
a real love for this field and chose to deepen my knowledge [42 school](https://42.fr/).

I am a fervent supporter of
[`open source`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) and strive to
contribute and help projects on Github or other platforms whenever possible. I
am curious and love to learn and discover new things, which makes me a
Jack-of-all-trades.

I try to put into practice [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public),
you can follow what I do in my [backlog](https://github.com/Its-Alex/backlog) and
see my [playground projects](https://github.com/Its-Alex?tab=repositories&q=playground).

I feel safe and happy in a structured environment. I think I'm better when I
can create a mind map of my work environment in my head.

# How I use notifications

Personnaly, I use smileys for short anser that don't need to trigger a notification:

- ‚úÖ I have noted the message or the task is complete or done
- üëç I respond affirmatively to the message
- üëÄ I am currently reading the message
- ü§î I am currently reflecting on this message

# Why I use conventional comment

I think that [conventional comment](https://conventionalcomments.org/) brings
several advantages:
- Priority among comments
- Perspective on the posted comment for the person reading it
In my opinion, this allows for better understanding and maintains a more neutral
aspect in the review.

# Tips about me

Here are some quick tips that will help you to understand me:

- By default, I tend to have high expectations, whether in reviews or during
  discussions. Feel free to bring it up to me, and I'll adjust to better fit the situation.
- **You feel safe debating with me**. I find that ideas improve by being
  examined from all angles. If it sounds like I'm disagreeing I'm most likely
  just playing devil's advocate. This does rely on us being able to have a
  safe debate.
- I type too fast and make spelling mistakes where there isn't a native spell
  checker. I'm working on it. üòÅ
