## Why I use conventional comment

I think that [conventional comment](https://conventionalcomments.org/) brings
several advantages:

- Priority among comments
- Perspective on the posted comment for the person reading it

In my opinion, this allows for better understanding and maintains a more neutral
aspect in the review.
