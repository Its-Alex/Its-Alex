# How I use notifications

Personnaly, I use smileys for short anser that don't need to trigger a notification:

- ✅ I have noted the message or the task is complete or done
- 👍 I respond affirmatively to the message
- 👀 I am currently reading the message
- 🤔 I am currently reflecting on this message
